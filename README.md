# R Programming @ Coursera

This is the second course in the Johns Hopkins University's Data Science Specialization program.

## Week 1: Overview of R, R data types and objects, reading and writing data (05/01/2019 - 05/01/2019)
This week covers the basics to get started on R. The Background Materials lesson contains information about course mechanics and some videos on installing R. The Week 1 videos cover the history of R and S, go over the basic data types in R, and describe the functions for reading and writing data.

Objectives:
* Install the R and RStudio software packages
* Download and install the swirl package for R
* Describe the history of the S and R programming lectures
* Describe the differences between atomic data types
* Execute basic arithmetic operations
* Subset R objects using the "[", "[[", and "$" operators and logical vectors
* Describe the explicit coercion feature of R
* Remove missing (NA) values from a vector

#### Quiz grade: 10.0/10.0

## Week 2: Control structures, functions, scoping rules, dates and times (06/01/2019 - 06/01/2019)
This week's lectures cover key topics like control structures and functions.

Objectives:
* Write an if-else expression
* Write a for loop, a while loop, and a repeat loop
* Define a function in R and specify its return value
* Describe how R binds a value to a symbol via the search list
* Define what lexical scoping is with respect to how the value of free variables are resolved in R
* Describe the difference between lexical scoping and dynamic scoping rules
* Convert a character string representing a date/time into an R datetime object.

#### Quiz grade: 10.0/10.0
#### Programming assignment grade: 10.0/10.0

## Week 3: Loop functions, debugging tools (13/01/2019 - 13/01/2019)

This week's lectures cover loop functions and the debugging tools in R.
* Define an anonymous function and describe its use in loop functions
* Describe how to start the R debugger for an arbitrary R function
* Describe what the traceback() function does and what is the function call stack

#### Quiz grade: 10.0/10.0
#### Programming assignment grade: 10.0/10.0

## Week 4: Simulation, code profiling (14/01/2019 - 15/01/2019)

This week's lectures cover how to simulate data in R, how to use the profiler in R, which lets you collect detailed information on how your R functions are running and to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed, as well as how to use the str function.
* Call the str function on an arbitrary R object
* Describe the difference between the "by.self" and "by.total" output produced by the R profiler
* Simulate a random normal variable with an arbitrary mean and standard deviation
* Simulate data from a normal linear model

#### Quiz grade: ???/10.0
#### Programming assignment grade: ???/10.0
