## Week 1: Overview of R, R data types and objects, reading and writing data (05/01/2018 - 05/01/2018)
This week covers the basics to get started on R. The Background Materials lesson contains information about course mechanics and some videos on installing R. The Week 1 videos cover the history of R and S, go over the basic data types in R, and describe the functions for reading and writing data.

Objectives:
* Install the R and RStudio software packages
* Download and install the swirl package for R
* Describe the history of the S and R programming lectures
* Describe the differences between atomic data types
* Execute basic arithmetic operations
* Subset R objects using the "[", "[[", and "$" operators and logical vectors
* Describe the explicit coercion feature of R
* Remove missing (NA) values from a vector
